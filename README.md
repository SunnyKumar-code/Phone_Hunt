## Project Overview

### How It Was Built

1. **HTML & CSS**: The structure and styling of the application were built using HTML and CSS. The layout is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

2. **JavaScript Functionality**: JavaScript was used to add interactivity and dynamic content loading to the application. Key functionalities include:
   - **Fetching Data**: Used the Fetch API to retrieve phone data from an external API.
   - **Dynamic Rendering**: Created and manipulated DOM elements to display phone information dynamically.
   - **Search Feature**: Implemented a search functionality that filters phones based on user input.
   - **Initial Display & Show All**: Initially displays a limited number of phones, with a "Show All Phones" button to reveal more.
   - **Popup Details**: Added event listeners to display detailed information in a popup when "Show Details" is clicked.

### JavaScript Highlights

- **Fetch API**: Used to asynchronously fetch phone data from a public API. This allows the application to load data dynamically without refreshing the page.

- **Event Listeners**: Added to buttons for handling user interactions, such as searching for phones and displaying additional details.

- **DOM Manipulation**: Utilized to create, update, and remove elements in the document, ensuring a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- **Conditional Rendering**: Implemented logic to show a limited number of phones initially and provide a button to display all phones, enhancing user experience.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Enter keywords to search for specific phones.
- **Initial Display**: View the first 10 phones with an option to see more.
- **Show All Phones**: Button to display all available phones.
